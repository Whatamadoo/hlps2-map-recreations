These are Half-Life PS2 decay and deathmatch map recreations I made for GMOD.
These use the halflife prop pack from the workshop (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=665025902) but only for the health/suit chargers, eye scanners, and pool props used in ht05dorms. The rest I had to port myself.
I MADE THESE WITH PORTING THEM TO SOURCE IN MIND. This means that some entitys have been changed on principle to work better in source, like replacing trigger_auto/relay and multimanagers to their source counterparts with appropriate input/outputs as well as changing the textures that are attached to entities that use the renderamt keyvalue to modified unlitgeneric versions or making non $transparent versions of textures etc etc.
Other than major player activated scripted events, these maps dont contain much entities and what entities are here are usually somewhat modified to work better in a sandbox environment.
Decay maps :
ht01accident : fully completed but old and bad. a lot of changes from the base map like making sliding door glass func_breakable and increasing renderamt value instead of using unlitgeneric. alot of nodraw faces were given textures along with extra functionality and buttons added to OOB areas.
ht01accident2 : only combined and de-disastered into accident1.
ht02hazard : have not started.
ht03uplink : barely started.
ht04dampen : fully completed. Has some changes I dont remember.
ht05dorms : fully completed. dont remember changes but I dont believe theyre too bad.
ht07signal : fully complete.
ht10focus : fully complete.
ht11lasers : fully complete.
ht12fubar : have not started.
ht91alien : fully complete. has some fake lights to better recreate original lighting

I also did these, same principles from above apply (changing ents, textures to work in source).
PS2 Deathmatch maps :
basement : fully complete
datacore2 : have not started (and no plan to)
debris : fully complete
office : fully complete
signal : fully complete (made seperately from ht07signal)
skirmish : fully complete
snark_pit2 : have not started (and no plan to)
stalkyard2 : have not started (and no plan to)
water_canal : fully complete
waypoint : fully complete
